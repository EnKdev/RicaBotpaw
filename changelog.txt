**__Rica Botpaw - Version 2.0.0-pre3__**
---------------------------
This is a highly experimental version, so I expect things to break!
If things work out though, then I can say goodbye to the old bot cooldown method!
We also have to part ways from some features though... it's not like they would've clashed with something new nonetheless.
Also, An oldie returns! More in the patchnotes.
---------------------------
- Replaced the old Bot cooldown method with a new method which counts per user (In other words: A user cooldown)
-- Unfortunately, we had to get rid of the games and certain other features
-- A more specific explaination on this is down below.

- ;random has a new (but old) face again! The random cats are back! Simply type `;random cat` in order to receive your random cat!
- There is now a daily feature which works each day, whenever my PC had to shut-down as well! Isn't that neat?
---------------------------
Current status:
Replacing bot-wide cooldown with a user-based cooldown: TESTING
Daily-feature: DONE
Migrating from an SQL Database to a JSON Backend: DONE
Using the JSON Backend for Botshops and User Inventories: TBA
---------------------------
Alright, so this is the part where I get a bit into the details now on why I removed the hashing commands and the games.
The thing is:
At times like these where my work evolves, I have to make some decisions every now and then which can either be hard
or very easy.
Sometimes these decisions consist of me removing certain functions.
I usually only remove these things though if they
A) Start to clash with the new code structure and certain backend features like the JSON Backend of how the bot handles it's data
or
B) Isn't just interresting to do or just blatantly boring to be in a general-purpose discord bot.
In this case, both of these reasons apply to the Hashing Module (Reason B) and the Games Module (Reason A)
It is my goal with this bot to achieve something mighty for just me alone.
If there are certain problems I cannot just easily avoid at this time as I am still going through a whole lot of learning, then it has to go this way.
I am sorry if there are people who enjoyed these games or commands, but sometimes, we all have to decide against one or another in favor for your own visions.
I hope you all understand this decision of mine. At least we got the random cat back, eh?
I'll see you all in the next update/pre-release/i don't even know anymore at this point.
Most sincerely
