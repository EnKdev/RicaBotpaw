**__Rica Botpaw - Version 1.9.0__**
---------------------------
Alright folks, i guess this is finally it!
Version 1.9 just dropped and it's big!
There is also a breaking change now except for the developer commands and the moderation tools. More detailed specifics down below.

I also want to mention that this is the first Update i didn't do myself alone due to it's size.
I want to thank AntiTcb, SystemWizard and Still for their help over at the Discord API Server for many things.
You guys rock and without you, this update wouldn't exist.
