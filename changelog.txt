**__Rica Botpaw - Version 2.0.0-pre8__**
---------------------------
- Changed Bot Prefix, replaced buggy user cooldowns with a modificated Ratelimit attribute based on Discord.Addons.Preconditions
-- New Bot Prefix is `rb!` by the way.
- The Image Module is now gone for good due to an assembly error. (Thanks assembly <.<)
-- What still exists is the image searching and random images.
---------------------------

Replacing bot-wide cooldown with a user-based cooldown: EVEN MORE TESTING... (I want to die.)
