**__Rica Botpaw - Version 2.0.0-pre2__**
---------------------------
- Fixed an issue with image related features by deprecating the ImageCore Standalone Library and porting it into the project itself.
- Added some hashing functionalities. This also added a new feature which has to be enabled with the ;conf command.
-- As always, the help about configuring is called with ;confhelp
---------------------------
**Future plans:**
+ Add signing functionalities (I might sound dumb with that plan)
+ Add encrypting/decrypting functionalities (Also might sound dumb with that plan)
+ Simplify Server Configurations
+ Add some hash modifiers (Inflate, GZip, Salt, BCrypt)
