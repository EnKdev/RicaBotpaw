**__Rica Botpaw - Version 2.0.0-pre6__**
---------------------------
-The way files are now stored has gotten a tad bit more secure as I added a little bit of Encryption to the contents, as well as some other encryption methods.
-- Due to this, every file has to be remade, so re-register now, otherwise it probably will error out.
-- (With this, I mean your user, inventory and guild config files.)
-Rica's default first status is now as followed: Rica Botpaw {RBConfig.BotVersion} | {RBConfig.BotSubVersionName}
