**___Rica Botpaw - Version 1.0.0-rc___**
-----------------------------------
Version 1.0 is close to be done, so here is the release candidate.
Here are the heaviest changes so far!
-----------------------------------
===MONEY===
-You can finally pay other people now! To do that, you can find info more below.

-----------------------------------
===AUDIO===
-You can finally start streaming music via YouTube! (Really laggy tho. Better not use this until... idk)

-----------------------------------
===IMAGES===
-Added a filter command so you can put your avatar through various filters. Isn't that nice?

-----------------------------------
======NEW COMMANDS======
`;currency store <User> <Amount>` -> Stores any amount you specified into your personal bank vault
`;currency pay <User> <UserToPay> <Amount>` -> If you have stored something into your vault, you can then pay others with it!
`;filter <Filter>` -> Puts your image through the filter you selected.
`;ytStream <Link>` -> Self Explainatory, is it?

-----------------------------------
It was really quite a hazzle to rewrite me to the state of it being whoopdiedoop!
Of course, some bugs here and there are still existant, but things never can be perfect, can they?

We see us with the next changelog guys, Happy commanding!
