**___Rica Botpaw - Version 1.7.1___**
-------------------------------------
Simplified the poll system a bit!
For example, earlier, you had to specify yourself in all cases to start, vote or end a poll.
Now, you can simply leave that last bit.

The new poll system usage is as followed:
`;poll start <Question>` -> Start the poll. If your question has multiple words, then replace the spaces with underscores.
`;poll vote <yes> or <no>` -> Let's you vote with yes or no on this poll.
`;poll end` -> Ends your poll.

On another notage: I implemented a duplication check for votes as well. Have fun voting!
