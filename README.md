# RicaBotpaw

A general purpose discord bot written by:
- EnK_/zi8tx/TheRealDreamzy

Current version: 1.0.0-rc

NOTE: I removed the bot's token in case you want to use my fabulous work!

----------
# Code of conduct:

I do not allow any modifications neither to the code of my bot or it's ImageCore Library except for the places i told you what to enter there.

----------
# Building the bot:

I strongly advice using Visual Studio 2017 Community to build the bot since it's written on .NET Core 1.0.
Just simply enter your bots token after stripping the projects from my Github so my Bot recognizes it as the announcement channels.

---------
THIS BOT USES MYSQL AS IT'S DATABASE! I ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND SETTING UP A MYSQL SERVER BEFORE TAKING IT INTO ACTION.
